1. **Comparison-Based**: Grades are assigned based on a comparison of students' scores, often following a normal distribution (bell curve). This ensures that only a certain percentage of students receive top grades, regardless of their absolute scores.

2. **Class Performance Matters**: A student's grade depends on how well they perform compared to others in the class. If the entire class performs poorly or exceptionally well, it impacts individual grades.

3. **Standard Distribution**: Typically, a fixed percentage of students receive each grade (e.g., A, B, C), with a set average grade for the class. This method helps prevent grade inflation.

4. **Advantages**: It can motivate students to outperform their peers and can be useful in classes with consistently high or low averages. It also normalizes grading when exams are particularly difficult or easy.

5. **Disadvantages**: Students' grades may suffer if surrounded by high achievers, and it may create unnecessary competition among peers rather than fostering a collaborative learning environment.

6. **Use Cases**: This system is commonly used in competitive academic environments where distinguishing between top performers is crucial.
