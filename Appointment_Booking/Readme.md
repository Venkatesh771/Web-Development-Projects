<p>The Hospital Appointment Booking System is a project designed to simplify and streamline the process of booking appointments with doctors. This system is typically used by hospitals and clinics to manage patient appointments, doctor availability, and scheduling conflicts.</p>

1. **User Registration and Login:** Patients can register and log in to the system to access booking features. Doctors and admins have separate login portals.
2. **Doctor Availability Management:** Doctors can update their availability, set time slots for appointments, and view their schedules.
3. **Appointment Booking:** Patients can view available doctors, select preferred time slots, and book appointments based on their convenience.
4. **Automated Notifications:** The system sends automated reminders to both patients and doctors about upcoming appointments via email or SMS.
5. **Reports and Analytics:** The system generates reports on patient visits, doctor schedules, and other important metrics for hospital management.
